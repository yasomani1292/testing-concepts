Postman:
	API testing tool
	Different request types
		GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
		Difference between GET and POST:
			GET - when not passing any sensitive / confidential data, not large parameters, 
			GET method passes request parameter in URL String while POST method passes request parameter in request body.
			GET request can only pass limited amount of data while POST method can pass large amount of data to server.
			GET request can be bookmarked and cached unlike POST requests.
			GET is mostly used for view purpose (e.g. SQL SELECT) while POST is mainly use for update purpose (e.g. SQL INSERT or UPDATE).
			
		DELETE: Entity to be deleted in the URI
			it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location
		
		PUT: Entity to be stored in the requested URI
			Modified version if already exist in origin
			If resource doesn't exist, URI will define a new resource
			If URI doesn't understandable by resource, it will not create/ modify / implement (501) 

	Different error codes

		201 - New resource created
		204 - No content -> If existing resource is modified
		501 - Not implemented (resource does not created / modified)
		301 - Moved permanently

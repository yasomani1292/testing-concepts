API Testing: Postman, REST-Assured, JMeter, SoapUI
	API testing tool
	Difference between API, REST and Web service?
	Different request types
		GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
		GET:
			Mostly used for read only / view
			Sending parameters in URL
			For not sensitive and confidential data
			Small size of data as parameter
			
		POST:
			
		Difference between GET and POST:
			GET - when not passing any sensitive / confidential data, not large parameters, 
			GET method passes request parameter in URL String while POST method passes request parameter in request body.
			GET request can only pass limited amount of data while POST method can pass large amount of data to server.
			GET request can be bookmarked and cached unlike POST requests.
			GET is mostly used for view purpose (e.g. SQL SELECT) while POST is mainly use for update purpose (e.g. SQL INSERT or UPDATE).
			
		DELETE: Entity to be deleted in the URI
			it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location
		
		PUT: Entity to be stored in the requested URI
			Modified version if already exist in origin
			If resource doesn't exist, URI will define a new resource
			If URI doesn't understandable by resource, it will not create/ modify / implement (501) 

	Different error codes - HTTP / HTTPS / REST:
		200	- Success / ok
		201 - Created -> New resource created
		204 - No content -> If existing resource is modified
		301 - Moved permanently
		400 - Bad request -> Non-specific failure. When no other error code (4XX) is appropriate
		401 - Unauthorized
		403 - Forbidden
		404 - Not Found -> When rest API can't map client URI to resource, but available in future
		500 - Internal Server Error -> 
		501 - Not implemented -> resource does not created / modified
